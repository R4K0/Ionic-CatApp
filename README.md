## Cloning & Getting Development instance set-up:
* Clone this repository to a seperate folder
* Open CMD/Terminal and cd into the directory
* Run "npm install" to install required dependencies, this will take a while. (Ensure you have installed node.js and npm is in your PATH)
* If you haven't already, install Ionic CLI - "npm install -g @ionic/cli"
* Run "ionic serve"
* Wait for the instance to open in your browser.

## Building for Android:
Follow instructions as defined here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android

## Things I've learned doing this project:
I always thought I disliked web-dev and mobile development - How wrong I've been! It's been geniunely one of the most exiting projects I've done in a long time.

I'd have used infinite scroll views that are bundled with ionic, but I couldn't gotten them to work - Many other people were having issues so I assume it's not a "me" problem.

## Credits:
2 RESTful API's were used in this project.
